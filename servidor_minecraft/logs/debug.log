 This configuration file allows you to define the general settings for the Mob Capture Cards.

 Allow and Deny list
 -------------------
 If you want to allow or deny specific mobs, you can use the allow and deny list.
 Keep in mind that if you add a mob to the allow list, all other mobs will be denied by default.
 There are two separate lists for kill and fishing drops.

  Example for allow only specific mobs:
    mobCaptureCardKillDropAllowList=minecraft:zombie,minecraft:skeleton
    mobCaptureCardKillDropDenyList=
    mobCaptureCardFishingDropAllowList=minecraft:cod,minecraft:salmon
    mobCaptureCardFishingDropDenyList=

  Example for deny specific mobs:
    mobCaptureCardKillDropAllowList=
    mobCaptureCardKillDropDenyList=minecraft:ender_dragon,minecraft:wither
    mobCaptureCardFishingDropAllowList=
    mobCaptureCardFishingDropDenyList=minecraft:squid,minecraft:turtle

 Supported rarities are:
  - COMMON
  - UNCOMMON
